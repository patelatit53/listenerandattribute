# listenerandattribute
Hello, we studied about ServletRequestListener interface in previous post. In this post, we will see how to use ServletRequestAttributeListener can be used to receive notifications whenever some attributes are added, removed or replaced in ServletRequest.  Why is the need?  Sometime we may have a requirement that web application must receive some notifications whenever some attribute is added, removed or replaced in a ServletRequest.  How can we achieve it?  Java EE specification provides an interface called ServletRequestAttributeListener which receives the notifications whenever attributes are added, removed or replaced in a ServletRequest. This interface has three methods.  attributeAdded(ServletRequestAttributeEvent event)  : receives notification when an attribute is added in ServletRequest. attributeRemoved(ServletRequestAttributeEvent event)  : receives notification when an attribute is removed from ServletRequest. attributeReplaced(ServletRequestAttributeEvent event) : receives notification when an attribute is removed from ServletRequest.
